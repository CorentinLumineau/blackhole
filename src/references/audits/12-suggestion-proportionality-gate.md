### Suggestion Proportionality Gate
*   **Scope**: this is a pre-finalize self-check the reviewer runs over its **own draft finding
    set**, immediately before returning `status: complete` — distinct from §§1–10's audits of
    the diff itself.
*   **Checklist**:
    *   No finding recommends an abstraction layer (interface, factory, strategy) for a single
        current consumer (`V-KISS-01`, `V-YAGNI-01`).
    *   No finding recommends speculative "future-proofing" not required by the diff
        (`V-YAGNI-01`).
    *   Each finding's proposed remediation complexity is proportionate to the problem — flag
        and downgrade any remediation that is >3× more complex than the problem for marginal
        gain (`V-PARETO-01`).
    *   No finding cites a `file:line` outside the PR diff's changed lines (`V-SCOPE-01`).
    *   No finding proposes refactoring a pre-existing pattern in code the diff does not touch
        (`V-SCOPE-01`).
*   **Disposition rule**: a finding failing any check above is downgraded to `NOTE` if it still
    names an in-diff `file:line`; remove it entirely if it does not.
*   **Rerouting rule (`V-PARETO-02`)**: when a finding is removed *solely* because it cites
    out-of-diff code — not because the underlying observation is invalid — re-tag it as a
    `V-PARETO-02` finding with `gain`/`effort` estimates (§ 6) instead of discarding it, so it
    flows into the existing `pareto_candidates` pipeline. This is the same discovery path a
    future ADR-006 hunt-wave candidate would use (cross-reference only, non-blocking).
*   **Rationalization Table** — recognize these patterns in your own draft findings and apply
    the stated disposition:

    | If a finding reads like... | Disposition |
    |------|--------------|
    | "While we're here, we should also fix…" | Out of scope — reroute per rerouting rule above, file separately |
    | "This adjacent function has the same problem" | Not this review's problem — reroute or drop |
    | "The whole module needs refactoring" | Separate initiative, not a review finding — reroute or drop |
    | "Best practice says we should…" | Applies only to new/changed code — downgrade or remove if it targets untouched code |
